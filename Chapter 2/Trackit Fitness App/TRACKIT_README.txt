Trackit

Trackit is an android app that allows the users to keep track of their daily movements. 
It communicates with the sensors in the phone to collect data describing the users' engagements in the day. 
Users have the option of turning on these sensors by just clicking a button on the app. 
Once the users turns it off, they can choose to save this data to disk. 
Then the users can click a button to see the analysis of their day's movements. 
The app summarizes the movement means in actions done by standing still, walking and being in a mode of transportation.
It gives the total distances grouped by movement, total time, and estimated calories burned. 
It goes on to recommend suitable activities the users can engage in the following day.
